- **🌙 10:00-11:00 PM** - Evening batch releases

## 🔧 Available Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **`browser_monitor.py`** | Main monitoring script | `python3 browser_monitor.py` |
| **`start_monitor.py`** | Environment wrapper | `python3 start_monitor.py` |  
| **`launch_monitor.py`** | Guided setup launcher | `python3 launch_monitor.py` |

### Alternative Launchers

**For guided setup with debug mode:**
```bash

python3 start_monitor.py
```
This ensures correct Python environment and dependency handling.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Chrome/ChromeDriver Issues
- **Cache cleared automatically** when webdriver-manager fails
- **Multiple fallbacks** - System ChromeDriver → Auto-detection → Fresh download
- **Better error messages** for debugging

### Common Issues
1. **"Exec format error"** - Fixed automatically by clearing corrupted cache
2. **"Browser window closed"** - Restart monitor, don't close Chrome manually  
3. **"Not logged in"** - Login in browser window and press Enter in terminal
4. **Email not sending** - Run `python3 test_email.py` to verify Gmail setup
5. **"externally-managed-environment" error** - Modern Python installations prevent system-wide pip installs

### Python Environment Issues
**If you see "externally-managed-environment" error:**

```bash
# Option 1: User installation (recommended)
python3 -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt

# Option 2: If Option 1 fails
python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt

# Option 3: Individual packages
pip3 install --user selenium webdriver-manager python-dotenv
```

**The `start_monitor.py` and `run_monitor.sh` scripts handle this automatically!**

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep both windows open** - Terminal + Browser window
2. **Have booking info ready** - Passport details, preferred dates, contact info
3. **Act fast on alerts** - Slots typically disappear within 2-5 minutes
4. **Monitor 24/7** - Cancelled slots can appear at any time, even 3 AM
5. **Browser auto-navigates** - Just fill the form when you get an alert
6. **Multiple time zones** - Embassy releases follow Rome time but monitor shows Pacific

## 🤝 Ethical Usage & Server Respect

- ⚠️ **Please don't** continue monitoring after booking successfully  
- ⚠️ **Please don't** share accounts or use this for commercial purposes
- ⚠️ **Please don't** modify the code to make more aggressive requests

**Note:** This tool relies on your integrity and responsibility. There are no technical restrictions - please be respectful!

### 🌟 **Best Practices:**
- ✅ Use longer intervals during busy periods (10-15 minutes)
- ✅ Focus monitoring during known release times
- ✅ Stop the monitor when you don't need it
